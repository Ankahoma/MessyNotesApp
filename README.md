# MessyNotesApp

That is a test project I'd applied for internship in one great company.
When I was given this task I knew nothing about Swift. 
So, it was very challeging to  get it working, but I did that)
The architechture is very, very messy. Actually, there is no architechture at all:)
But I was happy anyway to solve this the way I could for that moment, 
despite the fact that I didn't (of course!) succeed for that internship:)
